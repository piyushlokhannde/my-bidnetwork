# my-bidnetwork
We often see the lack of transparency and bad practices in the bidding process due to manual intervention. Now we can implement the whole bidding process with block chain technology to improve the transparency and manual intervention to very high limit.

This POC is implemented in the blockchain framework hyperledger(1.4) which provides many good things over public block chain.

Hyperledger framework allows

1) High transaction throughput.
2) We can add the nodes based on their role and restrict their functionality according to role.
3) It allows sharing of private data between two nodes allowing confidentiality between the two organization.

I have used above characteristics of the hyperledger to implement the this POC.
